# Train Game

The **Train Game** is a fun and challenging browser-based game inspired by the classic Snake, but with a train twist. Control a locomotive, pick up passengers, and avoid crashing into yourself or the boundaries. The game features animated graphics, sound effects, and intuitive keyboard and on-screen controls.

## Features

- Retro pixel-art style with custom train and passenger sprites.
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet screens.
- Animated backgrounds and visual effects (glow, flames, heartbeat).
- Keyboard and on-screen button controls.
- Booster mode for speed bursts (hold `Shift`).
- Score and lives tracking with visual feedback.
- Pause and restart with countdown after losing a life.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Move Up: `Arrow Up` or on-screen ‚Üë button
   - Move Down: `Arrow Down` or on-screen ‚Üì button
   - Move Left: `Arrow Left` or on-screen ‚Üê button
   - Move Right: `Arrow Right` or on-screen ‚Üí button
   - **Booster**: Hold `Shift` or on-screen Shift button for a speed boost

2. Pick up passengers (üßë) to grow your train and earn points.
3. Avoid crashing into the train itself or the edges of the board.
4. You have 3 lives. After each crash, the game restarts with a countdown.
5. The game ends when you lose all your lives.
