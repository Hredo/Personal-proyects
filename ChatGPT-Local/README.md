# Local Chat GPT

The **Local Chat GPT** project allows you to run a version of ChatGPT entirely in your web browser. This project uses WebLLM to create a local instance of GPT, enabling you to have conversations without needing an internet connection.

## Features

- Full-fledged ChatGPT experience in the browser.
- No internet connection required after initial setup.
- Real-time message display and user interaction.

## Running the Chat

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Personal-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd Personal-projects/local-chat-gpt
   ```
3. **Open `gpt.html` in your web browser**:
   - Similar to the Tennis Game, you can open the file directly or use a simple HTTP server.
